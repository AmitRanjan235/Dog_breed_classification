Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: yes


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, vgg uses classifier: red_wolf,_maned_wolf,_canis_rufus,_canis_niger
            resnet uses Classifier: capuchin,_ringtail,_cebus_capucinus 
            alexnet uses Classifier: border_terrier
            


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: No, resnet and vgg has some mistakes but alexnet correctly identifies, resnet and vgg has done misclassification because that images of dog is similar to another animal so it has done misclassification.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: alexnet perform the best, resnet and vgg has done some misclassifictions we can infer from the stats:
